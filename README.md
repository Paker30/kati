Keep track of all your lectures with this fancy app which allows you to share it between different devices!

## Why I've develop KATI

I keep a list of books I want to read (no matter if I have them or I have to acquire), most of the time I see the book at some library, read about it or someone suggest it to me and I add the book to my list; in order to share the list between different devices I use a shared Excel file (it works great and this solution provides me with many features) Also I like webapps because there's no need for me to install a heavy app in my device or being worry about updates thus, on the other hand I always wanted to develop a webapp with remote (but private) synchronization so... Thats the reason I've developed [KATI](https://kati-paker30.vercel.app/)

### How KATI synchronizes the content

KATI allows the user to share the book list between devices thanks to Google Drive, when a users login for the first time, KATI creates an application inside the user's Google Drive account, since that moment the user can have the list synchronized between all the devices he wants.

> ⚠️ At the current version, there's no alternative to Google Drive which means the user wouldn't be able to use KATI unless he had a Google account
